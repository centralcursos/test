                <p>
	<strong><em>&ldquo;Mmm look at that sexy hair! I wanna touch it so badly&rdquo;</em></strong> my wife yelled as the thick-haired African tribesmen started performing the final stage of their sacred hair regeneration and growth ritual.
</p>

<p>
	It was a hot July afternoon, we had just arrived on the island and there they were.
</p>

<p>
	49 men and women of all ages&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	From long hair to short hair, some men with beards I have only dreamed about&hellip; and women&hellip; their curls shining like polished ebony in the sunshine&hellip; their skin glowing like those of princesses&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	And dreadlocks so huge, it would have made any person alive die with jealousy in a split-second&hellip; if they saw them&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	It was pure madness!
</p>

<p>
	And it was that exact moment which led me to discover <strong>the incredibly well kept secret</strong> of the <strong>Himba tribesmen with horse sized ponytails&hellip;</strong>
</p>

<p>
	A ritual passed from generation to generation and carefully guarded by every man and woman from their tribe, literally at the price of their lives, based on a super growth cocktail that goes back over 2,000 years and <strong>can increase any person&rsquo;s hair density by 88%.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	EVEN if you&rsquo;re as bald as an egg.
</p>

<p>
	So stay right where you are for the next 3 and a half minutes, because I&rsquo;m going to show you how you too can use the same super cocktail and regrow your hair with at least 2,200 strands per square inch, just like over 120,000 men and women have done it before you.
</p>

<p>
	What I&rsquo;m about to tell you will shake the hair growth industry from its very core and will change everything you thought was real about going bald.
</p>

<p>
	You see, doctors all around the world falsely claim that losing your hair is just as normal as it is common.
</p>

<p>
	But as you&rsquo;ll soon see, even though this is very common, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing normal about it.
</p>

<p>
	Because the real truth is that today, going bald is completely optional&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	You don&rsquo;t need to rub your scalp daily with insane lotions, sprays or foams.
</p>

<p>
	You don&rsquo;t need to waste thousands on laser therapies.
</p>

<p>
	And you definitely don&rsquo;t need a life threatening hair transplant.
</p>

<p>
	Instead, as the latest clinical studies prove, in order to get thicker fuller hair and get rid of bald spots, all you need to do is fix a dangerous &ldquo;leak&rdquo; happening inside your body right now.
</p>

<p>
	First, I&rsquo;ll show you where this insidious leak comes from so you can see it for yourself how badly it affected your hair follicles...
</p>

<p>
	Then I&rsquo;ll share with you the incredible secret of the Himba tribesmen, that you can use at home to increase the number of hairs produced by every follicle by at least 2, 3 and even 4 strands in just a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, I&rsquo;ll show you all the scientific evidence that proves this clinically tested method is guaranteed to work for any man or woman out there.
</p>

<p>
	This secret ritual comes with a whole bunch of other advantages.
</p>

<p>
	It will help you get stronger, longer hair, giving you a thicker, more defined hairline&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	It will also significantly increase your energy levels, turbo boost your social life and even help you lose those nasty extra pounds off your belly.
</p>

<p>
	So listen up.
</p>

<p>
	Because we don&rsquo;t have much time left.
</p>

<p>
	If you&rsquo;re over 25 and secretly wish for a simple way to restore that bold mane of hair you used to have, but haven&rsquo;t been able to until now&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Then continue watching this presentation because your life and your hair are about to change forever.
</p>

<p>
	Trust me, I know how it feels to have your gut freeze every time she reaches out to touch your head and only finds those ridiculous scraggly hairs.
</p>

<p>
	Or to be completely humiliated when some people on the street accidentally see your bald spots on a windy day and look at you like you suffer from some illness.
</p>

<p>
	But right now, for the first time in your life, all this can change!
</p>

<p>
	Because today, having a full head of hair is solely at your own discretion!
</p>

<p>
	Of course, I don&rsquo;t want you to simply trust me on this.
</p>

<p>
	Instead I want you to hear from some of the 120,000 other men and women whose lives have been completely changed by this program.
</p>

<p>
	To be honest, stories like these don&rsquo;t even impress me anymore.
</p>

<p>
	Every day, our inbox is filled with dozens of success stories like the ones you just heard and they all confirm <strong>how incredible this extract is.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	And I should know.
</p>

<p>
	Because not too long ago, I saw it with my own eyes.
</p>

<p>
	Hi, my name is John Linkletter.
</p>

<p>
	Ever since I graduated from the UConn School of Medicine, I only had <strong>one goal in mind.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	To find a way out of the <strong>nightmare of going bald that&rsquo;s been plaguing my life since I was 19.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	During my long career I worked with <strong>many prestigious doctors,</strong> experts in their fields, people who&rsquo;ve shared my dream but also others who were so caught up in their classic treatment methods that they couldn&#39;t even see anything else clearly enough to take a chance on even looking at my alternative way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
	I&rsquo;ve seen and treated every single scalp and hair related condition, including hard cases of <strong>alopecia areata, male pattern baldness, AGA, telogen effluvium and even people who lost their hair due to chemo.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I was also honored to have been part of an elite team of researchers and medical experts that found the <strong>key chemical components</strong> of what was later released in the world as <strong>Finasteride.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In my <strong>over 35 years of experience</strong> I have helped over 5,000 American men and women regrow their healthy hair and confidence.
</p>

<p>
	But my long life dream never changed.
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to prove to myself and the entire medical community that <strong>hair loss is NOT a life sentence.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Almost 12 years ago I started my own private <strong>next-generation laboratory,</strong> together with some of the most brilliant scientists I&rsquo;ve met along the road.
</p>

<p>
	Ever since then, we&rsquo;ve been working with one purpose in mind:
</p>

<p>
	To research and develop an effective solution that will <strong>help any man or woman out there stop shedding</strong> immediately and restore all the hair they&rsquo;ve ever lost.
</p>

<p>
	Now, before we continue I need to explain something very important.
</p>

<p>
	You see, 85% of men in the US are balding by their mid 40s, according to the American Hair Loss Association (AHLA).
</p>

<p>
	And since it&rsquo;s so common, every dermatologist you&#39;d go to says it&rsquo;s just normal and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it.
</p>

<p>
	But <strong>that&rsquo;s a flat out lie.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Because as you&rsquo;ll soon see, there&rsquo;s <strong>absolutely nothing normal with losing your hair while you are still young and healthy.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Hair is just a natural part of your body, an organ just like your teeth.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	So why should losing your hair be less a catastrophe than losing your teeth?
</p>

<p>
	Now, a medical researcher&#39;s life isn&rsquo;t easy.
</p>

<p>
	You get a lot of <strong>sleepless nights, a neglected family</strong> and months of being absent from your home due to your job.
</p>

<p>
	I spent a lot of time abroad, working in <strong>high tech labs in Turkey or Germany,</strong> being part of international research teams, performing clinical research on male baldness and pattern hair loss.
</p>

<p>
	I remember all those moments when I left my family home, completely on their own.
</p>

<p>
	I used to blame myself all the time for that&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	But the stakes were too high.
</p>

<p>
	You see, in my opinion every disease, illness or health problem already has a <strong>natural, organic solution</strong> left to be discovered in nature.
</p>

<p>
	We just have to find it.
</p>

<p>
	That&rsquo;s why every year I would take one month off, and visit every indigineous place I could find, looking for the ancient <strong>natural solutions against hair loss</strong> that those people used <strong>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	From the deep dark Amazonian forest, to the beautiful lands of Tibet and India and the forgotten Japanese villages.
</p>

<p>
	During my trips, I collected and analyzed hundreds of herbs, plants and even tree produced oils.
</p>

<p>
	Some are already well known in the part of the medical community that specializes in hair loss, and while they may help recover some of the dormant follicles, each one of them was <strong>completely useless when it comes to actually fighting androgenetic alopecia.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I&#39;ll have to admit, things didn&rsquo;t look so good.
</p>

<p>
	I remember the night after the last trip when I came back to my wife, she had never seen me so upset in all my years.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>I felt stuck,</strong> as if nothing I was doing seemed to work.
</p>

<p>
	But if there was something that I never lost in all my life, that was <strong>hope.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Because as my mentor used to say:
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>&ldquo;Real accomplishments in life always needs to begin with a little bit of faith&rdquo;</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	And everything truly happens for a reason, because the call I would receive the next day <strong>changed my life forever.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	It was from a colleague of mine, Norman.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&ldquo;John, you have to see this!&rdquo;</em> , he said to me in a mysterious voice.
</p>

<p>
	Now, I knew he was onto something, but never in my wildest dreams have I dreamed of what would happen next.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&ldquo;Listen, one of my collaborators just called me to tell me about a remote</em> <strong><em>African island</em></strong> <em>where rich people go to</em> <strong><em>treat their hair loss.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<em>He had found this in his recent travels. Apparently they use some sort of plant infused potion.&rdquo;</em>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>&ldquo;Stop right there Norman,&rdquo;</em></strong> I said to him calmly.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re scientists and you know very well there&rsquo;s no such thing as magic potions.&rdquo;</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Norman paused for a second, then he started explaining how these tribesmen are literally <strong>defying science through their hair growth ritual.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	But I needed more than that.
</p>

<p>
	So I spoke more with Norman, getting him to give me the location of this tribe.
</p>

<p>
	I decided to take my wife with me, since she&rsquo;s a professor in anthropology and could help me understand the tribe&rsquo;s native language.
</p>

<p>
	Now, please be warned because <strong>what follows next is not for the weak of heart.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	After what I believe was the most time spent on an airplane plus 2 hours by boat, my wife and I finally found the <strong>remote indigenous African tribe.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	From the moment we stepped foot on the island, my wife and I <strong>stood there in shock.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I honestly tell you that all my years of medical research in the clinical trichology field could not have prepared me for this.
</p>

<p>
	We had just landed on the shore of their island, and <strong>there they were.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	More than a dozen natives standing in front of the tribe&rsquo;s elderly <strong>performing the sacred hair growth ceremony,</strong> or <strong>Saqqaramaba,</strong> by its local name.
</p>

<p>
	A couple more lucky tourists, who looked really rich, were quietly sitting in the back watching the whole process.
</p>

<p>
	And let me tell you.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Their thick black manes were absolutely insane.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Strong dense hair covering every inch of their heads,</strong> absolutely no doubt, the most impressive picture I have seen in all my long medical career.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>It was absolutely insane!</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<em>What in the world do these people do in</em> <strong><em>order to have those luscious thick locks?</em></strong> I asked myself.
</p>

<p>
	In the middle of the jungle, with <strong>no fancy shampoos or conditioners, and literally no hair product at all,</strong> each one of these people was still rocking tons of swinging layers.
</p>

<p>
	Little did I know back then that the answer to this question was going to shock me.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, science has already proven that African people have thicker hair than white men or women.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, in a recent research paper published by Medscape Journal, involving over 110 countries, stated that the lowest rates of androgenetic alopecia is found in Africans and Eskimos.
</p>

<p>
	Africans count for the <strong>top 3% of the world&#39;s best hair quality.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	But my main question was <strong>WHY?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I needed to find out if this was due to genetics or something else, <strong>something stranger?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	So I spent the next couple of weeks trying to get as close as possible to the tribe&rsquo;s elders.
</p>

<p>
	We actually became good friends and I was happy to share my medical knowledge with them, teaching them simple emergency procedures like how to safely stop an open wound from bleeding or how to give CPR.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time, I wanted to find out what was hidden behind their <strong>secret hair growth ceremony</strong> and the shockingly strong hair these people had.
</p>

<p>
	The tribal elders appreciated the help and with each day that went by, <strong>they slowly began sharing the secret</strong> behind this well kept secret ritual.
</p>

<p>
	They said that in their tribe, most babies are already born with a lot of hair on their heads and that&rsquo;s due to their parents adding a <strong>few powerful plants</strong> to their daily meals.
</p>

<p>
	But if by misfortune someone is born without hair on their head (which is considered an illness in their tribe), they use their <strong>sacred hair growth ritual and the newborn&rsquo;s scalp immediately starts to fill up.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	What&rsquo;s more important is that the tribesmen are advised to <strong>consume these plants and herbs every day,</strong> to prevent any <strong>hormonal imbalance or sexual disfunctions.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This recipe, as the elderly confessed, has been in their families for centuries and <strong>was passed from generation to generation.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all due to the lands we live in and the plants we have here,</em> <strong><em>the secret to our good hair has been here for thousands of years.&rdquo;</em></strong> one of the tribe elderly said.
</p>

<p>
	But is what they&#39;re saying truly possible? I asked myself.
</p>

<p>
	Can an ancient ritual and some strange herbs <strong>really regrow your hair?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Or was it really all down to science and in fact the quality of their hair and 0% rate of baldness was entirely due to their genetics?
</p>

<p>
	I knew if I wanted to find the answer, <strong>I needed to test it myself.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	And to be honest, I had a good reason to.
</p>

<p>
	You see, it&rsquo;s painful for me to admit this, but&hellip; <strong>I was balding too.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	You may not notice it at first because I wear hats all the time, even indoors.
</p>

<p>
	But&hellip;I mean, I know it and my wife knows it too.
</p>

<p>
	She just never said anything to me, even though we&rsquo;ve been married for almost 15 years.
</p>

<p>
	Well, she <strong>never said it to ME in my face.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	But a while ago I heard her talking over the phone with one of her friends, <strong>saying how sick she gets when we make love and my falling hairs go in her eyes or mouth.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	It felt like a <strong>cold steel blade was passing through my gut.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	And it felt so terrible because deep down I knew she was right&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Just go online and try to do a quick search on <strong><em>&ldquo;Does hair affect attractiveness?&rdquo;</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>What you&rsquo;ll find will shock you.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	New research published in the journal Evolutionary Psychological Science , found that bald men were judged to be less successful and less attractive by women.
</p>

<p>
	In the study, 120 women were shown pictures of men with or without hair, then asked to rate their personalities and traits.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Young women judged the man without hair to be significantly less attractive.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention all the online articles and forum posts where men share their confidence struggles and stories about being cheated on <strong>just because their spouse wanted someone better looking.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In fact, peer reviewed publishings show that <strong>more than 50% of women would never consider getting into a relationship with a man with a balding crown.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I knew I had a choice to make.
</p>

<p>
	I would either face a <strong>life of betrayal and humiliation</strong> or buck up and fix this once and for all.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&ldquo;I can do this,&rdquo;</em> I said to myself.
</p>

<p>
	So I decided to give this sacred <strong>&ldquo;African hair growth ritual&rdquo;</strong> a try.
</p>

<p>
	Even though <strong>I was skeptical</strong> right from the start.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, I was intrigued, especially since I&rsquo;ve seen those indigenous people performing it with staggering results.
</p>

<p>
	There had to be an explanation.
</p>

<p>
	As a scientist, I somehow thought for sure it had to do with genetics.
</p>

<p>
	But as the tribe elders explained to me, every now and then, a handful of very rich people, mainly Chinese billionaires, come to the island and <strong>pay large amounts of money to use this ritual and regrow their hair.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>And 9 out of 10 of them get staggering results!</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Even in the most severe cases, after only performing the ritual twice 100% of them successfully restored all the hair they&rsquo;ve lost.
</p>

<p>
	All this with <strong>ZERO side effects.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Because as the tribal elders confessed, this compound is all organic and natural..
</p>

<p>
	So, a couple days later, under the careful supervision of the tribe&#39;s elders, I started the hair growth ritual.
</p>

<p>
	The core of it was to <strong>drink this strange cocktail they prepared for me.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	From what I&rsquo;ve been told, the compounds found in the cocktail were extracted from the plants found around the island.
</p>

<p>
	The tribe&#39;s elders used a special process, drying the herbs, boiling them and adding their secret oil mix.
</p>

<p>
	They would take the end result, put it in a large pot and <strong>bury it 2 feet underground for 24 hours</strong> and only then the cocktail would be ready to use.
</p>

<p>
	Now of course, I started documenting everything.
</p>

<p>
	After I started to drink the cocktail, for the first few days, I didn&rsquo;t see any changes to my scalp, except for the fact that it felt like <strong>something curious was happening inside me.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Like I had more energy, I felt <strong>stronger and more powerful than usual.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Then there was something else I noticed happening from the first day since I started the ritual.
</p>

<p>
	I would always feel a different texture when I touched my bald spots, like there was hair growing but I couldn&rsquo;t see it yet.
</p>

<p>
	But then a few days later, <strong>something incredible happened.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	As I looked in the mirror at the back of my head, <strong>my heart skipped a bit.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>It had finally happened.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	My bald crown was filled with hair!
</p>

<p>
	I was so surprised to see hundreds of newborn hairs showing up and covering my skin head, I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes!
</p>

<p>
	My eyes were so used to seeing that bald skin on the top of my head that my brain was hardly able to process it!
</p>

<p>
	Now, after this initial improvement, <strong>the good news kept coming&hellip;</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Then as days went by, more and more hair appeared on my scalp and the shedding dropped to almost zero.
</p>

<p>
	Shortly after that, my entire head was filled with strong, thick hair, as I was honestly more and more amazed and shocked.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<h1>
	Just weeks later, I was a new person.
</h1>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	For the first time in my life, I felt like a real man!
</p>

<p>
	But the results didn&rsquo;t just stop here.
</p>

<p>
	Other parts of my body seemed to benefit as well, my skin looked healthier, my muscles were growing and looked more defined although I didn&rsquo;t perform any exercises during that period.
</p>

<p>
	I even noticed how I actually lost a lot of that belly fat I had gained over the years.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>My energy levels were skyrocketing and to be completely honest even my little guy down there seemed to gain a few extra inches. Was that my imagination?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	And I can&rsquo;t even begin to tell you how happy I was.
</p>

<p>
	I finally regrew all my hair again and not even a single piece of it fell out during the process!
</p>

<p>
	It was an extreme feeling of liberation.
</p>

<p>
	Then, one morning as I woke up and ran my hands through my hair, to my absolute shock, my hair felt thick and coarse like a cleaning brush.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>That was the moment when the tribe&rsquo;s elders</strong> decided I should stop the ritual.
</p>

<p>
	I was extremely confident that this was the Holy Grail of hair growth and the thing I&rsquo;ve been looking for all these years.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>My lifelong dream</strong> to end the suffering of millions of folks out there including myself.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>I just couldn&rsquo;t let it be.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I managed to follow around the tribe&#39;s elders for the next couple of weeks and secretly write down every plant and herb they used in the ritual and the exact way in which they dried <strong>, boiled and mixed each one of the ingredients.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	As soon as I finished my writings, I headed back to the States and began my work at the laboratory.
</p>

<p>
	So I teamed up with a colleague of mine, Dr. Krausz and we started a double-blind and placebo-controlled study, so that we could prove conclusively, with <strong>100% surety this ritual is guaranteed to regrow anyone&rsquo;s hair, no matter how advanced the thinning.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	The first thing we did was gather a group of 120 volunteers.
</p>

<p>
	We specifically asked them to be between 20 and 65 years old, and wanted to include people with all patterns of hair loss, from receding hairlines to balding crowns, diffuse thinning or completely bald heads.
</p>

<p>
	Some of them were <strong>extremely difficult cases.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Senior Americans who never in a million years believed they could get back control over their hair - something so important yet so many ignorant people take it for granted.
</p>

<p>
	But little did they know that their world was <strong>soon about to change.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In fact, the entire scientific community was going to change after seeing the results of this experiment.
</p>

<p>
	But before I tell you what happened next, let me show you <strong>something extremely strange</strong> that I&rsquo;ve discovered during our research.
</p>

<p>
	And trust me, you don&rsquo;t want to miss this!
</p>

<p>
	Because it was this exact moment that made me <strong>finally uncover the real mechanism behind the human hair growth cycle.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	You see, during our study, among other things, we asked our volunteers to do two things:
</p>

<p>
	First, they had to change their pillowcase every morning and send us the used one for tests <strong>,</strong> for two weeks.
</p>

<p>
	Second, we asked them to let us take high resolution photos of their scalp, using cutting edge cameras.
</p>

<p>
	All this under strict and absolute anonymity, of course.
</p>

<p>
	What we found was that all people, with no exception, that suffered from hair disorders, had <strong>two major things in common:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>First, their pillow case indicated the same sweating pattern, which was 70% higher than the normal night sweat.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>And second, their scalp tissue had the same greasy, shiny appearance.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Sure, this wasn&rsquo;t just a coincidence, but <strong>what was causing all this?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	You see, what Dr. Krausz and I uncovered was the fact that all volunteers with hair loss were passing all the essential nutrients their hair needed out through their sweat.
</p>

<p>
	And this was causing two side effects in their bodies:
</p>

<p>
	First, their scalp was shiny.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-1.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	Then, due to this nutrient deficiency, the skin of their head would turn a very subtle nuance of redness.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-2.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	And what we found was truly shocking.
</p>

<p>
	Let me explain:
</p>

<p>
	Not many people are aware of this, but In order for your hair to grow, as well as your other organs, it needs what scientists call essential growth nutrients.
</p>

<p>
	These essential growth nutrients are in fact the key to a proper development of the hair, as well as your entire body.
</p>

<p>
	Usually your body assimilates them from food.
</p>

<p>
	Essential compounds like Vitamin E, Vitamin B3 and minerals, iron, amino acids, calcium or potassium which are all found in the fruit produced by a tree called Sclerocarya birrea or otherwise known as the African Marula tree.
</p>

<p>
	No wonder African people safely prepare and consume this fruit on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
	In order for your hair to grow, your body needs these organic compounds like your brain needs oxygen.
</p>

<p>
	Now, you may wonder if all I need is these nutrients, why not just fill my body and scalp with them?
</p>

<p>
	Well, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that.
</p>

<p>
	You see, for some men, things were simpler, since their body was capable of properly assimilating all these important substances.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately for you, ever since you were born, your body has had some level of nutrient deficiency, hence the current condition of your hair.
</p>

<p>
	This happens due to a certain blockage inside your scalp&rsquo;s sweat glands, which makes your body incapable of absorbing these critical organic compounds.
</p>

<p>
	And the reason there are not enough resources to feed your scalp too is because you eliminate all these essential nutrients via sweat.
</p>

<p>
	Now, you may ask, but what&rsquo;s with the subtle shiny skin that every man with hair loss issues had on their scalp, that we uncovered during our study?
</p>

<p>
	Well, it&rsquo;s like this.
</p>

<p>
	You may have heard about allergies.
</p>

<p>
	An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance, usually one that&#39;s not harmful to your body.
</p>

<p>
	Some people have no allergies while others are mildly or even severely allergic.
</p>

<p>
	The same thing happens to your body when it comes to your hair cycle.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of assimilating these nutrients and helping your hair grow, ever since you were a little child, your body becomes &ldquo;allergic&rdquo; to them and blocks the absorption process.
</p>

<p>
	And depending on the stage of your hair loss, your body is mildly or severely nutrient &ldquo;allergic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
	In the alopecia cases, the body reactions were so subtle, if it weren&rsquo;t for the super high resolution cameras to take these incredible photos of the human scalp, we may have never noticed it and androgenetic alopecia would have still been a mystery for science.
</p>

<p>
	It was the shiny tone of the scalp skin that was so common among all men with hair loss that literally shocked us as the computer was printing the results.
</p>

<p>
	So, to get back to the matter at hand, if your body is unable to properly assimilate these critical nutrients, which are basically what makes your hair grow, your follicles will keep shutting down, no matter what you do.
</p>

<p>
	So the real reason why your follicles don&rsquo;t produce hairs anymore is not genetics or &ldquo;God&rsquo;s gift,&rdquo; as you were led to believe.
</p>

<p>
	But instead it&rsquo;s all due to something much more simple, that can be easily fixed and that&rsquo;s your body&rsquo;s inability to assimilate the essential nutrients required for hair growth.
</p>

<p>
	Now, the good news is that there are certain natural compounds that can eliminate the assimilation blockage for good and give your hair all the nutrients it needs to become denser and stronger.
</p>

<p>
	The bad news is that you&rsquo;d have to go to Africa to get them.
</p>

<p>
	But don&rsquo;t worry, in just a minute I&rsquo;ll show you how you can get past this inconvenient hurdle.
</p>

<p>
	Now, if you still wonder if your hair can assimilate all the essential nutrients it needs to grow and stay healthy, here&rsquo;s a simple trick you can do to verify this.
</p>

<p>
	Just go to the bathroom and look over two things:
</p>

<p>
	First, does your scalp get greasy more often than it used to when you were a child?
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-3.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	And second, are the bald spots on your head shinier than the rest of your scalp?
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-4.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-5.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	If your answer is yes to at least one of the questions above, I&rsquo;m sorry to say but you may be eliminating all the essential growth nutrients through your sweat.
</p>

<p>
	This was exactly what was happening to our balding volunteers.
</p>

<p>
	Now, according to the CDC, 1 in 10 children suffer from food allergies, with more than 50% of American people reported to suffer from at least one allergic reaction.
</p>

<p>
	Actually, that shouldn&#39;t be a surprise at all.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, according to a recent study published in The National Journal of Medicine, researchers observed that the scalp sweat of people that suffer from hair loss contained huge amounts of lactic acid.
</p>

<p>
	Now, let me ask you&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Did you ever wonder WHY MOST BALD PEOPLE HAVE THEIR SCALP SO SHINY?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In fact, if you pay attention to those people that tend to sweat a lot, they are either bald already or on the way to becoming bald.
</p>

<p>
	A 2020 randomized test performed on 1,659 men and women with hair loss showed that the lactic acid contained by the sweat, more precisely a larger quantity of sweat, reacted with the naturally present keratin (protein) molecules in the hair, damaging the natural roots of hair follicles.
</p>

<p>
	While lactic acid is good in some instances, it is very bad if it comes into contact with hair in excessive quantities.
</p>

<p>
	It gradually breaks down the hair&rsquo;s outer layer, which, in time, leads to the hair follicles to shrink and become much less productive.
</p>

<p>
	The lactic acid in the sweat will make the hair look and feel brittle, dry, and weak.
</p>

<p>
	Also, it has been shown that lactic acid is responsible for inflammation, which also negatively impacts the growth of hair because when inflammation occurs, the hair stops receiving a sufficient quantity of its much-needed blood supplies, which carry oxygen and nutrients.
</p>

<p>
	This inusually results in premature balding, weak and thinning hair, low sex drive and what&rsquo;s worse, shortening your hair life span by more than 19 years.
</p>

<p>
	That&rsquo;s why, no matter what you do, if your sweat system is clogged and your follicles can&rsquo;t assimilate all these essential nutrients, it will be impossible to get them to produce hair.
</p>

<p>
	It&#39;s like trying to eat cooked spaghetti through a straw.
</p>

<p>
	Or better yet.
</p>

<p>
	It&rsquo;s like trying to pour water into a closed bottle.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you do?
</p>

<p>
	You open the bottle first, right?
</p>

<p>
	Now, before I tell you how simple it actually is to unlock the key to super growth of your hair and fix all these years of damage to it, let me do a quick recap.
</p>

<p>
	Because of the blockage happening inside your sweat glands, your scalp eliminates all the essential nutrients it needs to grow.
</p>

<p>
	That&rsquo;s why your hair started to be thinner and prone to breakage in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	Since your nutrient absorption process is broken and all the nutrients you need are passed out of your body via sweat, your body is trying to compensate, sending the scarce resources wherever it sees fit and wherever is possible.
</p>

<p>
	For obvious reasons, your body chooses to supply your vital organs like heart, brain or lungs, leaving you hair follicles deprived and dying because they are not essential to your survival.
</p>

<p>
	But there is one more that messes up your entire hair cycle which is already disturbed by the lack of nutrients: lactic acid.
</p>

<p>
	Lactic acid present in sweat makes bald heads shine and is the main big culprit of hair loss.
</p>

<p>
	After accumulated on the scalp for a long period of time, lactic acid triggers an inflammatory process which leads to almost permanent hair follicle damage, so that hair does not grow as it should and is more prone to falling out.
</p>

<p>
	Ever since you reached puberty, without you even knowing it, you started eliminating essential nutrients through your sweat glands in your scalp on one hand and the lactic acid leak shrinked your follicles to death on the other hand.
</p>

<p>
	The end result: a bald shiny scalp, damaged hair cycle, miniaturized follicles incapable of growing normal sized hairs, and unfortunately what&rsquo;s even more scary - a 78% increased chance of developing severe hormonal imbalances.
</p>

<p>
	Now, getting back to the super African hair growth technique - Dr. Krausz and I performed tests on over 120 brave volunteers, men and women of all races between 20 and 65 years old.
</p>

<p>
	Our blend had all the natural super compounds, including the sacred herb from the Himba tribe which basically &ldquo;cleared the blockage&rdquo; and ensured the nutrient absorption process starts to function properly for immediate hair growth.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, I expected to see some results.
</p>

<p>
	But I sure as hell didn&rsquo;t expect to see them coming in <strong>that fast&hellip;</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Not long after we began, <strong>our phones were ringing like crazy</strong> with all these people explaining to us how they got their thick luscious hair back even better than before their hair loss started.
</p>

<p>
	I almost thought they were joking.
</p>

<p>
	But then the pictures arrived at our e-mail servers.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Take a look at this.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-6.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-7.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	Even the most skeptical ones, to their utter shock, got a full scalp of baby hair.
</p>

<p>
	But that&rsquo;s not even close to the good things that happened...
</p>

<p>
	<strong>100% of the participants</strong> reported an increase of the density of their hair and reduced bald patches in just a few weeks from using the program.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>It was absolute madness!</strong>
</p>

<p>
	So we decided to take everything we&rsquo;ve discovered, and put everything into a simple method that anyone could follow&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	We started looking for companies that would help us bring the plants into the States in bulk and manufacture them into easy to consume gummies.
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to scream it out loud, as I held in my hands the product that would finally give men and women all over the world an explosive growth of their hair.
</p>

<p>
	We called it&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Folixine</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-8.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	With its powerful mixture of 12 carefully selected ingredients, this 2,000 year old African hair growth formula is the only one of its kind in the whole world.
</p>

<p>
	It&rsquo;s guaranteed to ultra boost your hair growth on ALL areas of your scalp and increase your hair density in just a matter of weeks, and has already changed the lives of over 120,000 men and women.
</p>

<p>
	Each ingredient was carefully selected for its follicle boosting properties.
</p>

<p>
	And when combined together in the right quantities, all the <strong>12 superfoods</strong> have the ability to set you free from balding no matter how naked your scalp is right now.
</p>

<p>
	Every <strong>Folixine gummy</strong> is made here in the US, in our <strong>FDA approved and GMP certified facility,</strong> under extremely sterile, strict and precise conditions.
</p>

<p>
	All gummies are non-GMO and safe.
</p>

<p>
	They do not contain any stimulants or toxins and they are not habit or tolerance forming.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>And what we achieved is what most experts would call a medical breakthrough&hellip;</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Here&rsquo;s a short explanation on how these ingredients work and why they are so powerful&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	<strong>STEP 1: Your body absorbs these powerful nutrients</strong>
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you&rsquo;ve taken the first dose of <strong>Folixine</strong> , the nutrient absorption process begins.
</p>

<p>
	We combined <strong>12 powerful ingredients</strong> chosen from selected locations such as Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia and even the Brazilian Amazon.
</p>

<p>
	All these <strong>compounds</strong> are essential for doing two things:
</p>

<p>
	First, to fix the blockage inside your sweat glands that&rsquo;s forcing your body to eliminate the growth nutrients through sweat.
</p>

<p>
	And second, to regulate the lactic acid levels in your sweat in order to restart <strong>the cellular growth of your hair.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Since they are 100% natural and have been selected due to their purity, your body will immediately start absorbing them and the growth of your hair will begin immediately.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>STEP 2: Your scalp becomes blockage free and the healing process begins</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Before the actual hair growth process happens, we need to repair the damage on your scalp level.
</p>

<p>
	This is <strong>extremely important&hellip;</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Since your hair follicles were deprived for so many years by these essential compounds, we need to restore their health before anything else.
</p>

<p>
	To achieve this, we selected a <strong>very precise combination</strong> of Vitamin A and Vitamin C.
</p>

<p>
	This powerful duo will supercharge your hair growth and force out the lactic acid that accumulated under your scalp.
</p>

<p>
	The way these two elements work when fused together is truly spectacular.
</p>

<p>
	Now, what&rsquo;s special about this type of vitamin C is that it&rsquo;s one of the most powerful types out there, since it&rsquo;s derived from calcium ascorbate.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-9.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	It&rsquo;s 79% stronger than the one you find in the stores or pharmacies!
</p>

<p>
	According to extensive research, Vitamin C is regarded as the most important vitamin you can give to your hair, because it&rsquo;s the primary element that helps collagen formation.
</p>

<p>
	Collagen is a naturally occurring protein in the human body that supports skin elasticity and healthy hair.
</p>

<p>
	Not only does it strengthen your hair roots, but also makes sure that the new hairs you&rsquo;ll grow will be of the best quality: strong, nourished and easy to style.
</p>

<p>
	Enter Vitamin A.
</p>

<p>
	Vitamin A is often one of those forgotten vitamins. It&rsquo;s mostly known for its positive effects on eye health.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-10.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	But what most people don&rsquo;t know is that the same artery that supplies eyes with vital nutrients also travels to the scalp.
</p>

<p>
	That means that if there is a shortage of nourishing substances in your eyes, the body will automatically feed the eye, depriving the scalp.
</p>

<p>
	Safely introducing highly bioavailable vitamin A in your system will both nourish your eyes and make sure nutrients have a free path to travel directly to the roots of your hair.
</p>

<p>
	Then, as soon as the healing process is done, your growth will begin immediately.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>STEP 3: The hair growth cycle turns to normal</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Now pay attention, because from this point on, <strong>incredible things start to happen.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	First, to achieve explosive growth of your hair, we had to <strong>carefully select a proprietary blend of 12 ingredients.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Our star ingredient is Vitamin D3.
</p>

<p>
	Among the first symptoms of vitamin D3 deficiency is a sweaty head.
</p>

<p>
	If you have children, you probably remember that the first thing your physician asked you during the first months of your child&rsquo;s birth is whether your newborn has a sweaty head.
</p>

<p>
	The reason is simple, sweaty head and excessive sweating is one of the first and earliest symptoms of low vitamin D3 levels.
</p>

<p>
	And guess what?
</p>

<p>
	A recent study published by Medscape shows that more than 60% of American citizens suffer from vitamin D3 deficiency.
</p>

<p>
	By supplying your body with its natural dose of Vitamin D3, you make sure your head sweating is under control and therefore reduce both lactic acid and nutrient loss that blocks your hair from growing.
</p>

<p>
	Then we added an extremely pure form of Biotin extracted from a rare algae found in the Indian Ocean, which expedites the growth on a cellular level.
</p>

<p>
	Biotin restores keratin production in hair which was disrupted by lactic acid buildups and also increases the rate of follicle growth. It is also proven to prevent age related hair loss.
</p>

<p>
	But we didn&rsquo;t stop here.
</p>

<p>
	We also added Vitamin E, Vitamin B6, Folate, Sodium, and Iodine&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	All with one single purpose in mind:
</p>

<p>
	To help you turbo boost your hair growth on those bald patches inch after inch, both in length and density.
</p>

<p>
	As an added benefit, all these ingredients create a <strong>natural armor</strong> around your scalp, shielding it against scalp issues like dandruff and age related hair loss.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>STEP 4: You shield yourself against hair loss and revitalize your entire body</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In just a few weeks, <strong>you&rsquo;ll start to notice a difference in your bald or thinning spots.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This natural blend will increase hair density by 30%, 40% and even 56% more than what you have now.
</p>

<p>
	And there&rsquo;s more&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Because this blend is so powerful, every single cell of your body will start to <strong>transform and rejuvenate.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Pantothenic acid, one of the star ingredients of <strong>Folixine</strong> &hellip;
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/offerimages/folixine/images/custom/transcript/104-image-11.jpg">
</p>

<p>
	Not only helps with <strong>hair regrowth,</strong> but it also helps you eliminate <strong>bad cholesterol</strong> from the bloodstream and turn the food you eat into the energy you need.
</p>

<p>
	So you can watch your hair grow and your belly fat disappear at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	You will be able to sleep better, it will help with your digestion <strong>and even with losing weight.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, this exact combination of these plants reduces stress and anxiety making you feel <strong>stronger, happier and healthier</strong> and giving you better mental focus, boosting your memory and brain power.
</p>

<p>
	And of course, the ultimate goal for <strong>Folixine</strong> is to help you generate explosive growth of your hair.
</p>

<p>
	Every morning you&#39;ll wake up stunned by your new hair.
</p>

<p>
	And the new powerful confidence you have will make you a king among men and women.
</p>

<p>
	Now, you probably have two questions by now.
</p>

<p>
	First, how do I get my hands on this?
</p>

<p>
	And second, in which quantities should I take <strong>Folixine</strong> ?
</p>

<p>
	You see, it&rsquo;s hard for me to answer the first question.
</p>

<p>
	When we created <strong>Folixine</strong> we knew that in order for this formula to work, we had to source only the highest quality ingredients.
</p>

<p>
	This makes our ability to keep high stocks on hand, almost impossible.
</p>

<p>
	Now, since you&rsquo;re here, <strong>your package is reserved.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	But if you leave this page, we cannot guarantee supply when you come back.
</p>

<p>
	Then, regarding how you should use <strong>Folixine</strong> , the answer is simple.
</p>

<p>
	Take one <strong>soft gummy</strong> after breakfast, lunch or dinner, with a big glass of water, for at least 30 days.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, you will see the <strong>external improvements fast,</strong> but the internal ones, well, they may take longer to heal.
</p>

<p>
	That&rsquo;s why, after analyzing the results of <strong>over 120,000 men and women</strong> who&rsquo;ve successfully used this program, we recommend taking at least 3 bottles of <strong>Folixine</strong> over a period of 60 days.
</p>

<p>
	And if you want to be completely safe and don&rsquo;t take any chances, we recommend you take <strong>at least 6 bottles,</strong> or more, over a period of 120 days.
</p>

<p>
	This way you&rsquo;ll be <strong>absolutely sure</strong> your hair will achieve its full potential and stay healthy and strong for the rest of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Over a hundred thousand men and women have used <strong>Folixine</strong> with mind-blowing results.
</p>

<p>
	The average increase in the number of individual strands per inch for each one of them is absolutely staggering.
</p>

<p>
	They also experience less greasy scalp, better skin and even overall less sweating.
</p>

<p>
	Their sex drive and energy levels are skyrocketing.
</p>

<p>
	And their confidence levels are holding high and strong due to their new, luxurious mane.
</p>

<p>
	Now, I hope you understand why I initially wanted to sell this program for <strong>297 dollars.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	But while I could have easily done that and have people lining up, the truth is, I&rsquo;m not here to make myself money.
</p>

<p>
	I&rsquo;m almost retired.
</p>

<p>
	I made my money already.
</p>

<p>
	I&#39;m here to <strong>make an impact,</strong> and help as many men as possible get rid of the burden that&rsquo;s been following them for their entire lives.
</p>

<p>
	The one of not being good enough.
</p>

<p>
	Because with this program, you can <strong>finally regrow your hair to its full potential,</strong> just like God intended from the moment you were born.
</p>

<p>
	That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not going to ask you for 297 dollars&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Or even 97 dollars&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	For the program that has helped over 120,000 men just like you, while this website is still up, you can get the clinically proven formula that restores your head full of hair, in just a few weeks from now for only <strong>$69 a bottle.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Now, I know how important it is to 100% rejuvenate your scalp, and make sure you shield yourself from premature baldness.
</p>

<p>
	That&rsquo;s why after talking to our manufacturing partner, we decided to give a huge discount on the 3 bottle package of <strong>Folixine</strong> .
</p>

<p>
	You can get them for <strong>only 49 dollars per bottle,</strong> and also get <strong>free shipping</strong> from us, for as long as the current supply lasts.
</p>

<p>
	Once we run out of stock, the discount is gone forever.
</p>

<p>
	So select the <strong>3 bottle package,</strong> or any other package you want and join the <strong>120,000 happy men</strong> who now enjoy a their new life where they 100% eliminated hair loss and bald spots off their head
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, Big Pharma will see this.
</p>

<p>
	And when this happens, the secret will be fully blown and we&rsquo;ll be forced to take this website down.
</p>

<p>
	I simply don&rsquo;t have the resources to go head-to-head against the multi-billion dollar giants and their high-dollar legal teams.
</p>

<p>
	So go ahead and select your package now.
</p>

<p>
	Why miss this incredible opportunity when it&rsquo;s one step away?
</p>

<p>
	Make this just a small, yet extremely profitable investment that will pay dividends for the rest of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, three bottles of <strong>Folixine</strong> will strengthen your hair follicles, nourish your scalp and get rid of hair loss for the long term.
</p>

<p>
	Also repair the life threatening blockage in your sweat glands, giving you a glorious mane any Hollywood star would look up to.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a reason why <strong>98% of our users</strong> choose the 6 bottles package:
</p>

<p>
	Once you go with the 6 bottles package, in just 6 months from now you&#39;ll basically train your own immune system to defeat hair loss, so your hair is basically guaranteed to stay on your head to deep old age.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>You&rsquo;ll shield yourself against the toxic processes attacking your scalp,</strong> giving you flawless hair <strong>,</strong> skyrocketing energy levels and even boost your memory and focus.
</p>

<p>
	Many years will pass from now, and your hair will stay as strong and healthy as in your youth, and you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy every moment of good shiny hair making you look decades younger.
</p>

<p>
	And of course, we want to help you as much as we can.

<p>
	You give this program a try and experience the results as tens of thousands of men did before you.
</p>

<p>
	You see how good it feels to ALWAYS feel effortlessly handsome, in your best looking day, even when you just put on a tracksuit to walk your dog.
</p>

<p>
	And if for any reason whatsoever you are not satisfied with the results&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Even if you completely eliminated those bald spots but feel like your hair could be a little more dense...
</p>

<p>
	Send me or Dr. Krausz an email and <strong>we&rsquo;ll refund every penny you invested into this program.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	No hassle, no questions asked, no red tape.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>But you need to hurry.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I made <strong>a lot of enemies</strong> by posting this program online.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Vicious hair loss scammers</strong> who woke up this morning and noticed their bank account balance is a little slimmer than yesterday&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Snake oil drug manufacturers</strong> who don&rsquo;t know what to do with their remaining inventory of cheap knock-off products...
</p>

<p>
	Even <strong>angry hair transplant clinic owners</strong> who may soon be left out of business as word has already begun to spread about this program in all corners of our country&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Each one of them wants this site off the internet.
</p>

<p>
	So the next time my phone rings, and <strong>I&rsquo;m forced</strong> to take this program down, you&rsquo;ll be on your own.
</p>

<p>
	But why would you give up on your only real chance to <strong>knock off those bald spots forever</strong> and restore the density of your hair <strong>in just a few weeks,</strong> just like over 120,000 men, who have done it before you?
</p>

<p>
	Why shouldn&rsquo;t you be among them, when you have so little time to spend and so much to gain?
</p>

<p>
	<strong>You can give yourself a chance to change something today,</strong> on this page and hit the buy button below.<br>

    <p>This website (“Website”) is the property of <span class="_Tr4YYIMS">folixine.com</span> (“we,” or “us”). We respect our user’s privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information we collect from you when you visit and use our Website.</p>
    <p>Among other things, this policy describes the types of information we collect when you visit our website or utilize any of its functions, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to that information. By visiting this website or using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Service.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">1. GDPR Compliance Statement:</span> Pursuant to the terms of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and is the “Data Controller” with respect to all of the information collected from visitors to our Website and users of our Service. To ensure compliance with the GDPR, we have incorporated the following practices and procedures:</p>
    <p>(a) We verify that the third parties with which we share User information are GDPR compliant;</p>
    <p>(b) We ensure that data is stored in a manner that facilitates our ability to locate and delete information pertaining to a specific user upon request;</p>
    <p>(c) The manner in which we use the information we collect are limited to those discussed in this Privacy Policy;</p>
    <p>(f) If we modify any of the terms of this policy, we inform all of our Users; and</p>
    <p>(g) We have appointed an internal Data Protection Officer who is responsible for overseeing our privacy and data protection procedures and will serve as the individual point of contact for information access and deletion requests.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">2. Information We Collect.</span> We collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>
    <p>(a) Personal Data:</p>
    <div class="pl-32">
        <p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code. You may also provide us with additional Personal Data in any email messages you send to us, or in the form of user forum posts or chats.</p>
        <p>(ii) When and How do we collect it? We collect Personal Data from Users when: (1) they submit a contact form on our website; (2) initiate an online chat with us; or (3) submit a post to our User forum. In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
        <p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
        <p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
    </div>

    <p>(b) General Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual. &nbsp;This includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last web page you visited before visiting our website. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products. We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>
    <p>(i) How do we use General Information?&nbsp; General Information gives us insights on how people use the Service, and helps us to maintain, modify, and enhance it.&nbsp;We use cookies to help us customize your experience when using the Service. We also use services provided by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hotjar.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040236000" target="_blank">Hotjar</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040237000" target=")blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">ZenDesk</a>, which set cookies for each User when they visit our site or use our Service. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>(ii) Where is General Information Stored? All General Information collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on servers located in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040238000" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud</a>.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">3. How We Share information.</span> We will not share Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes without your consent. We will share Personal Data with certain third parties in the following ways:</p>
    <p>(a) Service Providers: &nbsp;We utilize the following third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf and must share certain information (including Personal Data) with them in order for them to do so. However, the information that is shared is limited to that which is necessary to perform their specific functions: &nbsp;</p>
    <p>(i) Amazon Web Services&nbsp;hosts our website (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040239000" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to view their privacy policy);</p>
    <p>(ii) ZenDesk&nbsp;provides us with customer support and chat services (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1585933040240000" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to view their privacy policy):</p>

    <p>(b) Law Enforcement:&nbsp; If requested or required by law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have about our users. We also may disclose your Personal Data to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
    <p>(c)&nbsp;Bulk Asset Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information, including Personal Data, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your Personal Data), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue to be used according to your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p>(d)&nbsp;Other Third Parties:&nbsp;We may reserve and have the right to disclose any information about you or your use of our Service without your prior permission, if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company or its affiliates, other Users of the Service or the public.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">4. How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to User information to employees who reasonably need access to it in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you. In addition, we have no control over the security of other web sites that you might visit even when a link may appear to those web sites site from our Site. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to log off and close your browser window when you have finished your session.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">5. How Long We Keep Information.</span> We retain Personal Data and General Information for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain elements of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time. You may also request that we delete your information in the manner described in Section 6.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">6. Your Options and Rights.</span> We currently offer Users the following options with respect to the manner in which we collect, use, and maintain information, or to otherwise exercise their rights under applicable privacy statutes:</p>
    <p>(a)&nbsp;All Users:&nbsp; You may request that we stop sending you non-account related emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of non-account related emails. You may also request that we delete the information we collected from and about you by contacting our Data Protection Officer. You may also request that we not share your Personal Data with one or more of the third parties we share it with. Be advised, however, that this may limit or prevent you from using our Website.</p>
    <p>(b) EU Citizens:&nbsp;If you are an EU citizen, you may request that we provide you with (or delete) all the information we collected from and about you, or otherwise exercise your rights under the GDPR by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Data reporting and deletion requests will be processed free of charge within thirty (30) days.</p>
    <p>(c) California Residents:&nbsp; Under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”), if you are a California Resident you may request information regarding the types of Personal Data we share with third parties for direct marketing purposes, and the identities of the third parties with whom we have shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. You may request further information about our compliance with CalOPPA by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Please note that under CalOPPA, we are only required to respond to one request per User each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through requests submitted to our Data Protection Officer.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">7. Tracking Technology and Do-Not-Track Requests.</span> We employ certain applications that may enable us to track your online activities over time and across third-party web sites. We honor Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">8. Children under 13.</span> Our Website is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 18, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

    <p><span class="_Tr4YYIMS">9. Modifications to this Privacy Policy.</span> We reserve the right to amend, alter, or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at our sole and absolute discretion. If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will notify all Users by a pop-up on our website. Further use of the Website following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
